# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
  In this Module 1 Challenge, 
### Purpose
  This purpose of this challenge was for Louise to be able to visualize how well other campaigns did in relation to their launch date and fundraising goals.  I was to deliver two charts to Louise based on technical analyses drawn from the Kickstarter campaigns.  The first analysis was to visualize the relationship between the outcomes of the campaigns based on their launch dates.  The second analysis was to display the percentages of the outcomes of each campaign in relation to their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?  

      One conclusion I can make about the Outcomes based on Launch Date is that the best months of the year to launch a campaign were May and June, as both months had over 100 successful campaigns.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
